* United Nations Development Programme – Human Development Index dataset

## Folder Structure
external/   → Original downloaded datasets (unchanged; filenames standardized)
raw/        → Selected and merged datasets (before cleaning)
processed/  → Cleaned datasets used for modeling

## How to Download the Data

## Data Processing Workflow
1. Raw datasets are stored in external/
2. Relevant indicators are selected and merged into raw/
3. Data is cleaned, normalized, and prepared for modeling in processed/

## Notes
* Original datasets in external/ are not modified (only filenames are standardized for clarity)
* Processed datasets can be reproduced using the notebooks in the /notebooks folder
